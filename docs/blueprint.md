# **App Name**: EnviroPact Form

## Core Features:

- Project Definition: Define project name, client name, and focal points (names, positions, emails). Option to add multiple recipients.
- Question Selection: Select questions to be sent to each recipient from a predefined question list.
- Email Dispatch: Send emails to recipients via mail.to, generating a confirmation upon sending.
- Recipient View: Display only the questions assigned to the logged-in recipient, restricting access via respondent ID. Include upload functionality.
- Local Storage for Responses: Temporarily store recipient responses in local storage until the form is submitted.
- Admin/Recipient Toggle: Implement a toggle button in the preview to switch between the administrator and recipient views.
- Form Completion Notification: The App notifies the form owner when all of the recipients completed their submissions. As a tool, it can assess whether the set of responses appear comprehensive, to reduce the chance that the report is missing content. 

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted teal (#468A8F) to evoke trust, environmental awareness and tranquility.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F3) to create a clean and professional look, focusing user attention on content.
- Accent color: Soft gold (#B0976D) as an accent to highlight important actions and confirmations, adding a touch of sophistication.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif, to convey both elegance and readability.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clear and professional icons related to data collection, reports, and user actions, consistent with the environmental theme.
- Maintain a clean, organized layout with clear sections for each step (project definition, question selection, recipient view, etc.)
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as form submission confirmations or toggling between views smoothly.
